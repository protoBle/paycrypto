firebase setup

1. Login 
firebase login
2. Test login status by listing project
firebase projects:list
(if unable to list, try to logout and login again)
3. Start firebase locally
firebase serve --only hosting,functions

Firebase hosting and functions uses different port (5000 & 5001). When try to get httprequest from functions, it will throw error. 
Solution: 
1. Use rewrite in firebase.json to all functions to serve from hosting url
